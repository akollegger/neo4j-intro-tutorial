Neo4j Tutorial Trainers Pack
============================

Contents:

* `Neo4j Intro Tutorial.key` - Keynote presentation (this is the master).
* `Neo4j Intro Tutorial.ppt` - Powerpoint presentation (a manually adjusted export
  from keynote).
* `Neo4j Intro Tutorial.pdf` - PDF export of selected slides, to be provided
  to students AFTER the tutorial.
* `USBKEY` - Contents of this directory should be placed onto USB keys and
  supplied to students.

Preparation:

* Provide students with printouts of the Cypher cheat-sheet, found
  in `USBKEY/DOCS/Neo4j_CheatSheet_v?.pdf`
* Provide students with printouts of the movie graph model, found
  in `USBKEY/DOCS/movies_model.pdf`
* Ensure a whiteboard is available. Ideally, project the presentation onto
  the whiteboard, to allow drawing over projected images.
* Ensure it's easy to switch between the presentation slides and using neo4j
  to demonstrate the examples. Note that examples can be copy/pasted from the
  slides.
* Customise your Keynote presenters display to show a large area for the notes
